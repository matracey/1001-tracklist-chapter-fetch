# **Project Requirements Document: Tracklist Chapter Extractor**

The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements of the Tracklist Chapter Extractor application.

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|----------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|
| FR001 | Accepting URL Input | As a user, I want to provide a 1001tracklists URL as input so the application can process the specific tracklist. | The application should accept a 1001tracklists URL as a command-line argument and validate that it follows the correct format. |
| FR002 | Fetching Tracklist Data | As a user, I want the application to extract tracklist information from the provided URL so I can use it for creating chapters. | Using Scrapling's fetcher capabilities, the application should fetch and parse the webpage content, handling any potential connectivity issues. |
| FR003 | Extracting Track Information | As a user, I want the application to accurately extract track names, artists, and timestamps from the tracklist so I can have complete chapter information. | The application should parse the HTML content to extract track numbers, track names, artists, and timestamp information from the 1001tracklists page. |
| FR004 | Handling Various Tracklist Formats | As a user, I want the application to handle different tracklist formats on the 1001tracklists website so it works reliably across different DJs and mix styles. | The application should be able to adapt to various tracklist layouts and formatting that might exist on the website. |
| FR005 | Converting to FFMETADATA Format | As a user, I want the extracted tracklist data to be converted to FFMETADATA format so I can use it with FFmpeg for adding chapters to audio files. | The application should format the extracted track information according to the FFMETADATA specification, including chapter markers with appropriate start times and titles. |
| FR006 | Saving Output File | As a user, I want the generated FFMETADATA content to be saved to a file so I can use it for further processing. | The application should write the formatted FFMETADATA content to a file at a user-specified location or a default location if none is provided. |
| FR007 | Customizing Output Filename | As a user, I want to specify the output filename for the FFMETADATA file so I can organize my files as needed. | The application should allow the user to specify a custom output filename via command-line argument. |
| FR008 | Command-line Help | As a user, I want to be able to see help information about the application's usage so I can understand how to use it correctly. | The application should provide helpful usage information when run with a help flag or with incorrect parameters. |
| FR009 | Error Handling | As a user, I want clear error messages when issues occur so I can troubleshoot problems effectively. | The application should provide informative error messages for common issues like invalid URLs, network problems, parsing errors, or permission issues when writing files. |
| FR010 | Progress Indication | As a user, I want to see the progress of tracklist processing so I know the application is working. | The application should display progress indicators during the fetching and processing stages. |
| FR011 | Adjusting Timestamp Format | As a user, I want the option to adjust timestamp formats so they're compatible with my specific audio file duration. | The application should provide options to handle various timestamp formats and conversions as needed for compatibility with FFmpeg. |
| FR012 | Handling Missing Timestamps | As a user, I want the application to handle cases where timestamps are missing in the tracklist so it can still generate usable chapter data. | When timestamps are missing, the application should provide a warning and either skip the affected tracks or use estimated timestamps based on available information. |

## Technical Requirements

| Requirement ID | Description | Details |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| TR001 | Python Compatibility | The application should be compatible with Python 3.8+ |
| TR002 | Scrapling Integration | Utilize Scrapling library for web scraping with appropriate stealth settings to avoid detection |
| TR003 | FFMETADATA Compliance | Generate output files that strictly follow the FFMETADATA format required by FFmpeg |
| TR004 | Minimal Dependencies | Rely primarily on Scrapling and standard Python libraries to minimize installation complexity |
| TR005 | Error Logging | Implement appropriate error logging for troubleshooting |
